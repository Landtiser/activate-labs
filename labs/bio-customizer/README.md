## Customization

This lab is white-label ready. To rebrand:

1. Open `bio-customizer.html` in a text editor
2. Find/Replace "Chris Landtiser" with your organization name
3. Find/Replace "landtiser.com" with your website
4. Optionally update CSS color variables (line ~27)

Look for `<!-- YOUR BRAND -->` comments for key locations.

## Troubleshooting

**Don't see "New agent" option?**
Your Copilot license may not include agent-building capabilities. Contact your IT admin.

**Page won't load?**
Clear browser cache or try an incognito/private window.

**Agent ignores opportunity details?**
Be explicit in your prompt. Try: "Using the bio I uploaded, create a version tailored for [specific client/opportunity]."
